# BMI Calculator

BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It's a measure used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. It's calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.

# The formula is:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))

BMI is commonly used as a screening tool to identify potential weight problems in adults. However, it's important to note that BMI doesn't directly measure body fat and doesn't account for factors like muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition. So, while it's a useful tool for many people, it may not be accurate for everyone, especially those with a lot of muscle mass.
